Seatmap Availability Exercise:

Write a python script that parses the example seatmap response (OTA_AirSeatMapRS.xml) and return a JSON object that lists the seats with the next properties:
	- Type (Seat, Kitchen, Bathroom, etc) Done
	- Seat id (17A, 18A) Done
	- Seat price Done
	- Cabin class Done
	- Availability Done

Please avoid the use of xml to json libraries/tools such as xmltodict, objectify and the like.

And any other properties you might find interesting or useful.

The output json format is not defined, so feel free to choose whatever you think best represents the information
